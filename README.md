## ⚡ What is Solder Sidekick™?

Solder Sidekick™ is an **open-source project** that converts a standard **Ender-3 3D printer** into an **automated through-hole soldering robot**.

It uses a **simple web interface** where you upload your **drill files** (from your Gerber PCB files), configure your component settings, and generate the **G-code** needed to precisely solder each pin.

[👉 Launch the Solder Sidekick™ Web App](https://rinthlabs.com/products/solder-sidekick-notification-sign-up)

- 🔥 Automates tedious manual soldering
- 🔥 Reduces human error
- 🔥 Great for small-run production and prototypes
- 🔥 Designed to be **affordable**, **modular**, and **extensible**

## 🛠 Why is Solder Sidekick™ valuable?

Soldering lots of **through-hole parts** by hand is time-consuming, tiring, and error-prone — especially for **small businesses**, **makers**, and **prototype builders**.  
Until now, solutions were either:
- Very expensive (industrial selective soldering machines) 💸
- Very DIY and unreliable 🛠️

**Solder Sidekick™** solves this by offering:
- An easy-to-assemble hardware kit
- An intuitive browser-based software tool
- Low-cost conversion based on an Ender-3 (a widely available 3D printer)

## 🏪 Get a Kit (Save Time and Hassle!)

While Solder Sidekick™ is open-source, sourcing the parts and machining the custom soldering iron tips can be difficult.

**Buying a full kit from our Shopify store** makes your life much easier:
- ✅ All hardware parts included (except Ender-3)
- ✅ Included custom machined soldering tips
- ✅ Semi-assembled kit saves you time
- ✅ Supports the project!

## 🧪 Example PCB Breadboard

Want to test out the Solder Sidekick™ right away? We include a custom breadboard-style PCB in each kit as a sample project — great for demos and getting started.

![PCB Breadboard](/example/screenshot.png)

This board is:
- Based on an open-source design by [Soldered Electronics](https://www.soldered.com/)
- Modified to include ["locking pin"](https://web.archive.org/web/20241003224515/https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/114) footprints for easier soldering
- Branded with the Solder Sidekick logo

You can find the gerber and drill files for the example [**PCB Breadboard**](./example/) in this repository.

📎 The breadboard PCB is licensed under the [TAPR Open Hardware License v1.0](https://tapr.org/the-tapr-open-hardware-license/), with all original and modified work credited and preserved.
