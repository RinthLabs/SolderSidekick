## ⚡ What is Solder Sidekick?

Solder Sidekick is an **open-source project** that converts a standard **Ender-3 3D printer** into an **automated through-hole soldering robot**.

It uses a **simple web interface** where you upload your **drill files** (from your Gerber PCB files), configure your component settings, and generate the **G-code** needed to precisely solder each pin.

- 🔥 Automates tedious manual soldering
- 🔥 Reduces human error
- 🔥 Great for small-run production and prototypes
- 🔥 Designed to be **affordable**, **modular**, and **extensible**

---

## 🛠 Why is Solder Sidekick valuable?

Soldering lots of **through-hole parts** by hand is time-consuming, tiring, and error-prone — especially for **small businesses**, **makers**, and **prototype builders**.  
Until now, solutions were either:
- Very expensive (industrial selective soldering machines) 💸
- Very DIY and unreliable 🛠️

**Solder Sidekick** solves this by offering:
- An easy-to-assemble hardware kit
- An intuitive browser-based software tool
- Low-cost conversion based on an Ender-3 (a widely available 3D printer)

## 🏪 Get a Kit (Save Time and Hassle!)

While Solder Sidekick is open-source, sourcing the parts and machining the custom soldering iron tips can be difficult.

**Buying a full kit from our Shopify store** makes your life much easier:
- ✅ All hardware parts included (except Ender-3)
- ✅ Included custom machined soldering tips
- ✅ Semi-assembled kit saves you time
- ✅ Supports the project!
